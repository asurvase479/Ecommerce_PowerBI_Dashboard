# Ecommerce_PowerBI_Dashboard

ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Data Visualization Project using Power BI! ðŸ“Š

I recently designed and developed an interactive eCommerce sales dashboard to track and analyze online sales performance across various dimensions ðŸ“¦ðŸ›’.

ðŸ”§ Key Highlights:

Built using advanced parameters to allow in-depth data drilling and user customization.

Implemented dynamic filters and slicers for enhanced interactivity and exploration.

Integrated multiple data sources with joins, relationships, and calculated fields to deliver real-time insights.

Created a variety of custom visualizations including:

Stacked bar & column charts

Donut charts

Interactive slicers

KPI cards

And more...

This dashboard empowers stakeholders to explore sales by category, region, customer, and timeâ€”leading to faster, data-driven decisions.
